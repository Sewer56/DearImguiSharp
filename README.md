# DearImguiSharp

DearImguiSharp is a minimalistic *personal use* .NET wrapper for the immediate mode GUI library, Dear ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) built ontop of [cimgui](https://github.com/Extrawurst/cimgui). The goal of Dear ImGui is to allow a developer to build graphical interfaces using a simple immediate-mode style. 

By itself, Dear ImGui does not care what technology you use for rendering; it simply outputs textured triangles. Many example renderers exist such as ones for popular graphics APIs: OGL2, OGL3, D3D9 and D3D11 etc.

## Motivation

I originally built this because I believe that while it generates more optimal, convenient bindings, [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET) is too fragile. The custom written binding generator is difficult to maintain and does sometimes break between source library updates.  

Normally this wouldn't be a big issue; but 

## Goals of DearImguiSharp

- Maintenance ease.  
	- Uses tried and tested Mono binding generator [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp).  
	- Uses minimal code fixes/changes, in hope API changes wouldn't break things.  

- Vanilla  
	- No redefinitions of method names etc.  
	- Makes it easy to use original C++ documentation for learning the library.  

- Exposes Internal APIs & Backends:  
  - Exposes `internal` Dear ImGui API that's often omitted from other wrappers.  
  - And Win32, D3D9/11/12, OGL2/3, GLFW, SDL2 & Vulkan backends.  
  - For more details, see [DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds](https://github.com/Sewer56/DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds).  

The goal is to be as 'minimal effort' in the wrapper generation step as possible.  
For this, we wrap `cimgui` as opposed to the original `imgui` project [C more reliable to wrap].

## Usage

Aside from capitalization being modified to match general C# code using CppSharp, the library API should exactly match the original source library.

- All structures reside in the `DearImguiSharp` namespace.  
- All functions reside in the `DearImguiSharp.ImGui` class.  
- Some custom defined functions reside in `DearImguiSharp.ImGui.Custom`. These are hand-generated for user convenience; but might not always be up to date.  
- Access to raw P/Invokes is available via `ImGui.__Internal`.  

```csharp
using DearImguiSharp;

// Elsewhere in code.
_context = ImGui.CreateContext(null);
ImGui.StyleColorsDark(null);
```

Please note that the bindings don't have default values for some parameters; where a default value exists in the original API, you can pass null, 0 or the default value for the given type.

## Known Issues

### Strings 
- Setters for strings (e.g. `IO.IniFilename`) are not correctly generated.  

Code generates as e.g.
```csharp
byte[] __bytes0 = global::System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(value);
fixed (byte* __bytePtr0 = __bytes0)
{
  ((__Internal*)__Instance)->LogFilename = (__IntPtr) new global::System.IntPtr(__bytePtr0);
}
```

This is not good, string will be invalid after garbage collection.  

As a workaround, manually marshal the string in the meantime, e.g. `((ImGuiIO.__Internal*)io.__Instance)->IniFilename = Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi("tweakbox.imgui.ini");` Don't forget to free it!  

### Const Struct Params
Const parameters for certain value types are incorrectly generated by CppSharp.  

For example, `PushStyleColorVec4` should have `int idx, ImVec2.__Internal val` as parameters and not `int idx, IntPtr val`.  

The example above and many others I have tried to fix, but there's no guarantee.  

## Building

### Building cimgui

- Go to [DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds](https://github.com/Sewer56/DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds).  
- Follow instructions in the readme.  

### Building the Wrapper

- Clone this repository and its submodules.  
- Go to [DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds](https://github.com/Sewer56/DearImguiSharp-NativeBuilds) and then the `cimgui` submodule.  
- Replace headers (`cimgui.h`, `cimgui.cpp`, `cimgui_impl.h`) in `CodeGenerator` project with the ones created using cimgui.  
- Build and run `CodeGenerator`. Copy autogenerated `cimgui.dll.cs` to `DearImguiSharp` and compile.  

## Testing

I don't have any test project currently available in this repository. I originally built this library to create overlays for existing applications by hooking the DirectX API.  

In that vein, you may check out [Reloaded.Imgui.Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Reloaded.Imgui.Hook) which utilizes this library. This is what I use to test the library.  

As I am not a graphics programmer, contribution of any sample program would be highly appreciated.  

## Performance Recommendation(s)
From a performance enthusiast; CppSharp doesn't generate the most efficient code (it's full of reference types!) so let's not make the GC trigger happy.

- Avoid the heap like the plague.  
    - Especially with types like `ImVec2` and `ImVec4`. 
	- This means do not use  `var vector = new ImVec2();`.
	- Use the stack! 
- Assume everything is disposable (use `using` statement).
  - Or you'll probably be leaking memory. 
	
How? This library goes out of its way to expose the low level P/Invokes and structures autogenerated by CppSharp (normally private).

Don't do this:

```csharp
using var vector = new ImVec2(); // Heap allocation + Unmanaged Heap Allocation + Dictionary Entry
ImGui.CalcTextSize(vector, text, null, false, -1.0f);
```

This is slightly better (but limits you to stack):

```csharp
var vecInternal = new ImVec2.__Internal();
var vector = new ImVec2(&vecInternal); // Heap allocation
ImGui.CalcTextSize(vector, text, null, false, -1.0f);
```

This is the best:
```csharp
var vecInternal = new ImVec2.__Internal();
ImGui.__Internal.CalcTextSize((IntPtr) (&vecInternal), text, null, false, -1.0f);
```
	
This library is a *minimal effort* library. We try to manually fix the least amount of things so hopefully in the future we can just wrap newer versions of dear imgui without worrying about API changes.

## To Do

- Modify CppSharp generator to not redefine typedef'd void\*\* to IntPtr as this produces incorrect code (no implicit conversion from void\*\* to IntPtr).
- Optimize wrapper by using more efficient bindings. (e.g. Map `ImVec2` to `System.Numerics.Vector2`).

- Support other operating systems:
  - Modify `DearImguiSharp.targets` to add support for other platforms.
  - Implement CI/CD or Github Actions to build `cimgui` for other platforms. 
  - Some kind of reasonable test; maybe use [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid).

I plan to address these in the future but it likely wouldn't be any time soon.

This is my first time using CppSharp, so there's still plenty of stuff to still learn.
I'll happily accept pull requests for any of these features or general quality of life improvements.

I was pretty surprised by `Mochi.DearImGui` when I discovered it (Sept. 2022) personally; but cannot unfortunately use it as there isn't `win-x86` support and adding it to the code generator would unfortunately be a lot of work, with the mess that ABIs are under `win-x86`.
